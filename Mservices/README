Mservices uses an Embedded Derby database.

The database is created in memory every time the server start, but will need a folder where to write the
derby log. The top directory of the derby database must be set on the TomEE server. Locate file
Servers/TomEE at localhost-config/catalina.properties and add to the bottom:
derby.system.home=some_path_on_your_computer

If the database should be accessible from a normal Java application, open Project/Properties and locate
Run/Debug settings. Mark the project and click the Edit button. Open pane Arguments and add to
VM Arguments
-Dderby.system.home=the_same_path_as_above

If you would like to keep the database between restarts of the server, replace the connection URL in the file
Mservices/WebContent/META-INF/context.xml
Replace
       url="jdbc:derby:memory:DAT152_Memberlist;create=true"
with
       url="jdbc:derby:DAT152_Memberlist;create=true"
